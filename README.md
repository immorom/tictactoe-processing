# Tic-Tac-Toe (Processing)

This is an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe written in [Processing](https://processing.org/) in order to make it work on Android.

The second player is not AI controlled. It is meant to be played by two players sitting next to or accross from each other on a single phone or tablet.

This was written during my December holidays in 2012 (the code has not been touched since). I was fresh out of my very first programming class at university, so this code may not be a good example of proper coding practices and conventions.
